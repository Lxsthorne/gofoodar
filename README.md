This is a work in progress based on an introductory project available on Revature.com. 
I wanted to test my knowledge of basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript while creating 
something new. The project also introduces "drawing board" concepts like
reading/creating SRS, converting PSD's to HTML, life cycle development 
process and more. 

This page will be updated as I move through the learning sections.
